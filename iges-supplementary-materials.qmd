# Study Overview

This supplementary page provides detailed visualizations and additional analyses for the study on dyslipidaemia risk prediction presented in our conference poster.

- **Study Design:** Cross-sectional analysis using baseline data from the CONSTANCES and POPGEN prospective cohort studies.
- **Population:** French adult population enrolled in both CONSTANCES and POPGEN cohorts.
- **Primary Outcome:** Prevalent dyslipidaemia at baseline.

# ðŸ“ˆ Dyslipidaemia Risk Score Distribution

The distribution of the LPC risk score across the entire cohort and between cases and controls provides the first insight into its predictive power.

# ðŸŽ¯ Model Evaluation

## Discriminative Ability

The model's ability to distinguish between individuals with and without dyslipidaemia diagnosis was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC).

::: {.figure-caption}
**Figure 5:** Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for the dyslipidaemia risk score.
:::
:::

The AUC of 0.70 indicates a modest level of discrimination between cases and controls.

## Risk Stratification

The most critical test for clinical application is whether the score can stratify the population into meaningfully different risk groups. We binned participants into 60 bin percentiles based on their LPC risk score and calculated the observed disease prevalence within each bin.

::: {.figure-container}
![](assets/images/iges-2025/percentiles-prevalence.png)

::: {.figure-caption}
**Figure 6:** Disease prevalence across percentiles of the LPC risk score.
:::
:::

There is a linear increase in disease prevalence across risk score percentiles, with the highest prevalence (80%) found in the 100th percentile. This confirms a continuous association between the score and disease status but indicates that the score's utility for isolating a narrow, highest-risk group may be constrained.
