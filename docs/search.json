We binned participants into 60 bin percentiles based on their dyslipidaemia risk score and calculated the observed disease prevalence within each bin.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Disease prevalence across percentiles of the dyslipidaemia risk score.\n\n\nThere is a linear increase in disease prevalence across risk score percentiles, with the highest prevalence (80%) found in the 100th percentile. This confirms a continuous association between the score and disease status but indicates that the score’s utility for isolating a narrow, highest-risk group may be constrained.\n\n\nIGES 2025 Annual Meeting | Poster: 80 | Session: 2 | Presenter: Florence Ghestem\nFor questions or collaborations, contact florence.ghestem@inserm.fr\nThis work is part of the Inserm cross-cutting program GOLD (GenOmics variability in health and Disease)."
