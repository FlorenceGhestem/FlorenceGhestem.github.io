    "section": "Risk Stratification",
    "text": "Risk Stratification\nThe most critical test for clinical application is whether the score can stratify the population into meaningfully different risk groups. We binned participants into 60 bin percentiles based on their LPC risk score and calculated the observed disease prevalence within each bin.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Disease prevalence across percentiles of the LPC risk score.\n\n\nThere is a linear increase in disease prevalence across risk score percentiles, with the highest prevalence (80%) found in the 100th percentile. This confirms a continuous association between the score and disease status but indicates that the score’s utility for isolating a narrow, highest-risk group may be constrained.\n\n\nIGES 2025 Annual Meeting | Poster: 80 | Session: 2 | Presenter: Florence Ghestem\nFor questions or collaborations, contact florence.ghestem@inserm.fr\nThis work is part of the Inserm cross-cutting program GOLD (GenOmics variability in health and Disease)."
